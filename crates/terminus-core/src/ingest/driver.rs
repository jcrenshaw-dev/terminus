//! The one pass driver (#31).
//!
//! A tree pass, a backfill and one named file are the same pass with a
//! different walk, so they run through one function in one order: take the
//! lock, recover, read the rows, walk, and write one `runs` row. Each caller
//! hands [`drive`] its own [`Walk`]. The steps only the tree pass runs - the
//! decision log drain, continuation links, labels, observations, retention and
//! the snapshot gate - are that walk's own, and every step a walk does not name
//! does nothing, so the backfill and a named file stay out of them by
//! construction.
//!
//! The driver starts no thread. The backfill's workers are started inside its
//! own walk, which is reached only by `terminus backfill`.
